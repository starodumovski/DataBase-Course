2. It computes the unique **sname**s of **Suppliers** who supplied **red** and **green** **Parts** with the **cost** less than 100 for each part. But it can be different suppliers but with identical **sname**
3. It computes the **sid**s of **Suppliers** who supplied **red** and **green** **Parts** with **cost** less than 100 for each part.
  It can differ from other ones because here we have the **primary_key** **sid**, while suppliers can have the same **sname**s 
4. It computes the unique **sname**s of Suppliers who supplied **red** and **green** **Parts** with the **cost** less than 100 for each part. (Suppliers can have the same **sname**s)
